# WonderWillow
This is an Endless Runner I created loosely based
around my little baby girl's eating habits!
I followed a couple of tutorials to get me started
and then personalised everything to suit my needs.
Adding new content and mechanics where I needed it.

It's not currently playable on touch screen devices
unfortunately. It' something I'll be working on at
a later date.

You'll need the keyboard arrow keys to control it.

This one is a bit of fun.
Bright, jovial and a little addictive.

It's available to play on my website
